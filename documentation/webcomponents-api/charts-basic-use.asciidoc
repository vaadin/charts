= Basic Use

The [classname]#vaadin-<type>-chart# is a regular web component, which you can add to a
web page.

You can load the chart in 'header' and then use it in the 'body'.
A chart has a height of 400 pixels and takes full width by default. Anyway the chart will adapt its size
to its container element size if that has the size specified.

Web Components:

The chart types are described in
<<dummy/../../../charts/webcomponents-api/charts-charttypes#charts.charttypes,"Chart Types">>. The
main parts of a chart are illustrated in <<figure.charts.overview.elements>>.

[[figure.charts.overview.elements]]
.Chart Elements
image::img/charts-elements-lo.png[]

To actually display something in a chart, you typically need to configure the
following aspects:

* Basic chart configuration
* Configure __plot options__ for the chart type
* Configure one or more __data series__ to display
* Configure __axes__

The plot options can be configured for each data series individually, or for
different chart types in mixed-type charts.

[[charts.basic-use.configuration]]
== Basic Chart Configuration

After adding a chart web component to your html page, you need to configure it further. At the least, you need
to specify the data series to be displayed in the configuration.

The chart-specific properties can be changed by adding <property-name> tags into the chart. Here we add
title and subtitle to the chart. By convention, [elementname]#title# should be used, but it is a reserved
tag name in HTML and does not allow child elements. In Vaadin Charts, a `chart-` prefix is added to fix this
kind of issues. So, instead of using reserved tags, [elementname]#area#,
[elementname]#frame#, [elementname]#style#, and [elementname]#title#,
use the following elements: [elementname]#chart-area#, [elementname]#chart-frame#, [elementname]#chart-style#,
and [elementname]#chart-title#.

[source, html]
----
<vaadin-bar-chart>
  <chart-title>Planets</chart-title>
  <subtitle>The bigger they are the harder they pull</subtitle>
  ...
</vaadin-bar-chart>
----

The configuration properties are described in more detail in
<<dummy/../../../charts/webcomponents-api/charts-configuration#charts.configuration,"Chart
Configuration">>.


[[charts.basic-use.plotoptions]]
== Plot Options

Many chart settings can be configured in the __plot options__ of the chart or
data series. Some of the options are chart type specific, as described later for
each chart type, while many are shared.

For example, for line charts, you could disable the point markers as follows:

[source, html]
----
<plot-options>
  <line>
    <marker enabled="false"></marker>
  </line>
</plot-options>
----

You can set the plot options for the entire chart or for each data series
separately, allowing also mixed-type charts, as described in
<<charts.basic-use.mixed>>.

The shared plot options are described in
<<dummy/../../../charts/webcomponents-api/charts-configuration#charts.configuration.plotoptions,"Plot
Options">>.


[[charts.basic-use.data]]
== Chart Data Series

The data displayed in a chart is stored as `data-series` elements.

[source, html]
----
<data-series name="Diameter">
  <data>
    4900, 12100, 12800, 6800,
    143000, 125000, 51100, 49500
  </data>
</data-series>
----

Data point features, such as color and size, can be defined inside the `data-series`
element. The data series configuration is described in more detail in
<<dummy/../../../charts/webcomponents-api/charts-data#charts.data,"Chart Data">>.


[[charts.basic-use.axis]]
== Axis Configuration

One of the most common tasks for charts is customizing its axes. At the least,
you usually want to set the axis titles. Usually you also want to specify labels
for data values in the axes.

When an axis is categorical rather than numeric, you can define category labels
for the items. They must be in the same order and the same number as you have
values in your data series.

[source,html]
----
<x-axis>
  <chart-title>Planet</chart-title>
  <categories>Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
              Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune</categories>
</x-axis>
----

Formatting of numeric labels can be done with `format` attribute which is a string
where '{value}' will be replaced by the actual y-label value.

[source,html]
----
<y-axis>
  <chart-title>Diameter</chart-title>
  <labels format = "{value} Mm">
    <step>2</step>
  </labels>
</y-axis>
----

More complex formatting, needs to be done using `formatter` which is a
JavaScript function to format the label.

[source,html]
----
<y-axis>
  <chart-title>Diameter</chart-title>
  <labels formatter = "function () { return this.value / 1000 + 'Mm';}">
    <step>2</step>
  </labels>
</y-axis>
----


[[charts.basic-use.two-dimensional]]
== Displaying Multiple Series

The simplest data, which we saw in the examples earlier in this chapter, is
one-dimensional and can be represented with a single data series. Most chart
types support multiple data series, which are used for representing
two-dimensional data. For example, in line charts, you can have multiple lines
and in column charts the columns for different series are grouped by category.
Different chart types can offer alternative display modes, such as stacked
columns. The legend displays the symbols for each series.

[source, html]
----
<!-- The data Source:
V. Maijala, H. Norberg, J. Kumpula, M. Nieminen
Calf production and mortality in the Finnish
reindeer herding area. 2002. -->
<data-series name="Bear">
  <data>8, 30, 37, 13, 3</data>
</data-series>
<data-series name="Wolf">
  <data>0, 1, 0, 23, 10</data>
</data-series>
<data-series name="Wolverine">
  <data>7, 30, 22, 4, 9</data>
</data-series>
<data-series name="Lynx">
  <data>0, 2, 2, 1, 0</data>
</data-series>
----

The result for both regular and stacked column chart is shown in
<<figure.charts.basic-use.two-dimensional>>. Stacking is enabled with the
columns plot-options property `stacking`.

[source, html]
----
<plot-options>
  <column>
    <stacking>normal</stacking>
  </column>
</plot-options>
----

[[charts.basic-use.mixed]]
== Mixed Type Charts

You can enable mixed charts by setting the chart type in the
'data-series' element, which overrides the default
chart type of `vaadin-<type>-chart` element. You can also make color and
other settings for the series in the plot options.

For example, to get a line chart, you need to use type `line`.

[source, html]
----
<data-series name="Bear">
  <type>column</type>
  <color>blue</color>
  <data>8, 30, 37, 13, 3</data>
</data-series>
<data-series name="Wolf">
  <type>line</type>
  <color>red</color>
  <data>0, 1, 0, 23, 10</data>
</data-series>
----

In the above case, where we set the chart type for each series, the overall
chart type is irrelevant. As long as, it does not change the order of the axis
like 'bar' chart would do.


[[charts.basic-use.3d]]
== 3D Charts

Most chart types can be made 3-dimensional by adding 3D options to the chart.
You can rotate the charts, set up the view distance, and define the thickness of
the chart features, among other things. You can also set up a 3D axis frame
around a chart.

[[figure.charts.basic-use.3d.pie]]
.3D Charts
image::img/charts-3d-pie.png[]

[[charts.basic-use.3d.options]]
=== 3D Options

3D view has to be enabled in the `options3d` configuration, along
with other parameters. Minimally, to have some 3D effect, you need to rotate the
chart according to the `alpha` and `beta` parameters.

Let us consider a basic scatter chart for an example. The basic configuration
for scatter charts is described elsewhere, but let us look how to make it 3D.

[source,html]
----
<vaadin-scatter-chart>
  ...
  <chart>
    <options3d enabled="true"
               alpha=10
               beta=30
               depth=300
               view-distance=100>
  </chart>
  ...
</vaadin-scatter-chart>
----

The 3D options are as follows:

`enabled`:: Whether 3D plot is enabled. Default is `false`.

`alpha`:: The vertical tilt (pitch) in degrees.

`beta`:: The horizontal tilt (yaw) in degrees.

`depth`:: Depth of the third (Z) axis in pixel units. Default is 100.

`chart-frame`:: Defines the 3D frame, which consists of a back, bottom, and side panels that
display the chart grid.

[source,html]
----
<chart-frame>
  <back size="1" color="#F5F5DC"></back>
</chart-frame>
----

`view-distance`:: View distance for creating perspective distortion. Default is 100.

[[charts.basic-use.3d.plotoptions]]
=== 3D Plot Options

The above sets up the general 3D view, but you also need to configure the 3D
properties of the actual chart type. The 3D plot options are chart type
specific. For example, a pie has 'depth' (or thickness), which you can
configure as follows:

[source,html]
----
<plot-options>
  <pie>
    <depth>45</depth> <!-- Our pie is quite thick -->
  </pie>
</plot-options>
----


[[charts.basic-use.3d.data]]
=== 3D Data

For some chart types, such as pies and columns, the 3D view is merely a visual
representation for one- or two-dimensional data. Some chart types, such as
scatter charts, also feature a third, 'depth axis' for data points. That third
axis is called a Z axis.

Such data points can be given as arrays of three elements.
[source,html]
----
<data-series name="3D data">
  <color-by-point>true</color-by-point>
  <data>
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
    [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, -1.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, -1.0]
  </data>
</data-series>
----

Alternatively, the data points can be given as objects which have 'x', 'y' and 'z' properties.
[source,html]
----
<data-series name="3D data">
  <color-by-point>true</color-by-point>
  <data>
    {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z:0.0},
    {x:1.0, y:0.0, z:0.0},
    {x:0.0, y:1.0, z:0.0},
    {x:0.0, y:0.0, z:1.0},
    {x:-1.0, y:0.0, z:0.0},
    {x:0.0, y:-1.0, z:0.0},
    {x:0.0, y:0.0, z:-1.0}
  </data>
</data-series>
----

Above, we defined 7 orthogonal data points in the 2x2x2 cube centerd in origo.
The result is illustrated in
<<figure.charts.basic-use.3d.scatter>>.

[[charts.basic-use.3d.distance]]
=== Distance Fade

To add a bit more 3D effect, you can do some tricks, such as calculate the
distance of the data points from a viewpoint and set the marker size and color
according to the distance. To add custom JavaScript to do this,
https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/templates.html#dom-bind[dom-bind]
element can be used. More information about binding data to a chart can be found
<<dummy/../../../charts/webcomponents-api/charts-data#charts.data,"here">>.

[source,html]
----
<template id="fade" is="dom-bind">
  ...
  <vaadin-scatter-chart id="fadeChart">
    ...
    <data-series name="Data" data="[[distanceFadeData]]">
    </data-series>
  </vaadin-scatter-chart>
</template>
<script>
  var fade = document.querySelector('#fade');
  fade.addEventListener('dom-change', function() {
        var viewX = 0; var viewY = 0; var viewZ = 0;
        calculateViewPoint();

        fade.distanceFadeData =  [createPoint(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
                                  createPoint(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
                                  createPoint(0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
                                  createPoint(0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
                                  createPoint(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
                                  createPoint(0.0, -1.0, 0.0),
                                  createPoint(0.0, 0.0, -1.0)];

        function calculateViewPoint() {
          var viewDist = 2;
          var fadeChart = document.querySelector('#fadeChart');
          var alpha = fadeChart.chart.options.chart.options3d.alpha;
          var beta = fadeChart.chart.options.chart.options3d.beta;
          var theta = alpha * Math.PI / 180;
          var phi = beta * Math.PI / 180;
          viewX = viewDist * Math.sin(theta) * Math.cos(phi);
          viewY = viewDist * Math.sin(theta) * Math.sin(phi);
          viewZ = - viewDist * Math.cos(theta);
        }

        function createPoint(x, y, z) {
            var distance = calculateDistance(x,y,z);
            var grayness = parseInt(distance*75);
            return {x: x, y: y, z: z,
                    radius: 1+ 10/distance,
                    color: createColor(grayness)};
        }

        function createColor(color) {
            return "rgb("+color+","+color+","+color+")";
        }

        function calculateDistance(x, y, z) {
            return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(viewX - x, 2) +
                             Math.pow(viewY - y, 2) +
                             Math.pow(viewZ - z, 2));
        }
  });
</script>
----

Note that here the view distance is in the scale of the data coordinates, while
the distance defined in the 3D options has different definition and scaling.
With the above settings, which are somewhat exaggerated to illustrate the
effect, the result is shown in <<figure.charts.basic-use.3d.fade>>.
