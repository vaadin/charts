[[charts.installing]]
= Installing Vaadin Charts

As with most Vaadin add-ons, you can install Vaadin Charts as a Maven or Ivy
dependency in your project, or from an installation package. For general
instructions on installing add-ons, please see
<<dummy/../../../framework/addons/addons-overview.asciidoc#addons.overview,"Using
Vaadin Add-ons">>.

Vaadin Charts 4 requires Vaadin 8.0 or later.

Using Vaadin Charts requires a license key, which you must install before
compiling the widget set. The widget set must be compiled after setting up the
dependency or library JARs.

[[charts.installing.maven]]
== Maven Dependency

The Maven dependency for Vaadin Charts is as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.vaadin&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;vaadin-charts&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;[replaceable]##4.0.4##&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
----
You also need to define the Vaadin add-ons repository if not already defined:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
   <id>vaadin-addons</id>
   <url>http://maven.vaadin.com/vaadin-addons</url>
</repository>
----


[[charts.installing.ivy]]
== Ivy Dependency

The Ivy dependency, to be defined in [filename]#ivy.xml#, would be as follows:

[subs="normal"]
----
&lt;dependency org="com.vaadin" name="vaadin-charts"
            rev="**4.0.4**" /&gt;
----
It is generally recommended to use a fixed version number, but you can also use
[literal]#++latest.release++# to get the latest release.


[[charts.installing.license]]
== Installing License Key

You need to install a license key before compiling the widget set. The license
key is checked during widget set compilation, so you do not need it when
deploying the application.

You can purchase Vaadin Charts or obtain a free trial key from the
link:https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/vaadin-charts[Vaadin Charts download
page] in Vaadin Directory. You need to register in Vaadin Directory to obtain
the key.

.Obtaining License Key from Vaadin Directory
image::img/directory-download-license-key.png[]

To install the license key in a development workstation, you can copy and paste
it verbatim to a [filename]#.vaadin.charts.developer.license# file in your home
directory. For example, in Linux and OS X:

[subs="normal"]
[source,xml]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#echo# "[replaceable]##L1cen5e-c0de##" &gt; [parameter]#~/.vaadin.charts.developer.license#
----
You can also pass the key as a system property to the widget set compiler,
usually with a [literal]#++-D++# option. For example, on the command-line:

[subs="normal"]
[source,xml]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#java# -D[parameter]##vaadin.charts.developer.license##=[replaceable]##L1cen5e-c0de## ...
----

license key installation instructions] for more details.

[[charts.installing.license.environments]]
=== Passing License Key in Different Environments

How you actually pass the parameter to the widget set compiler depends on the
development environment and the build system that you use to compile the widget
set. Below are listed a few typical environments:

Eclipse IDE:: To install the license key for all projects, select "Window > Preferences" and
navigate to the "Java > Installed JREs" section. Select the JRE version that you
use for the application and click [guibutton]#Edit#. In the [guilabel]#Default
VM arguments#, give the [parameter]#-D# expression as shown above.

Apache Ant:: If compiling the project with Apache Ant, you could set the key in the Ant
script as follows:


+
[subs="normal"]
[source,xml]
----
&lt;sysproperty key="vaadin.charts.developer.license"
             value="**L1cen5e-c0de**"/&gt;
----
+
However, you should never store license keys in a source repository, so if the
Ant script is stored in a source repository, you should pass the license key to
Ant as a property that you then use in the script for the value argument of the
[literal]#++<sysproperty>++# as follows:


+
[subs="normal"]
[source,xml]
----
&lt;sysproperty key="vaadin.charts.developer.license"
    value="**${vaadin.charts.developer.license}**"/&gt;
----
+
When invoking Ant from the command-line, you can pass the property with a
[parameter]#-D# parameter to Ant.

Apache Maven:: If building the project with Apache Maven, you can pass the license key with a
[literal]#++-D++# parameter to Maven:


+
[subs="normal"]
[source,xml]
----
[prompt]#$# [command]#mvn# -D[parameter]##vaadin.charts.developer.license##=[replaceable]##L1cen5e-c0de## package
----
Continuous Integration Systems:: In CIS systems, you can pass the license key to build runners as a system
property in the build configuration. However, this only passes it to a runner.
As described above, Ant does not pass it to sub-processes implicitly, so you
need to forward it explicitly as described earlier.
