<p>As you might have noticed, Vaadin Charts supports print and save
	buttons like the underlying Highcharts library. In a typical Vaadin app
	this approach is a bit naive. If the user wishes to print the document,
	he/she can probably just use the browsers default print feature and
	print the whole document instead of just the chart. And if the same
	chart should be used in e.g. a PDF report, the generation of the report
	most likely happens in the very same JVM on the server side - not in
	the end user's device.</p>
</p>
<p>
	Although the chart rendering happens using JavaScript in the browser,
	modern web technologies also make it possible to use the exact same
	chart image on the server side. Vaadin Charts contains a helper that
	uses <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> in your server
	to render the chart in the SVG format. The generated SVG can then be
	handled with tools like <a
		href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/">Batik SVG Toolkit</a> and
	countless Java document handling libraries. The setup is closely
	related to Highcharts' very own export server, which can also be used
	with Vaadin Charts.
</p>
<p>As an example you can try to click the SVG and PDF buttons. In both of them
	the chart on this page is first rendered into SVG format using the
	built-in helper in Vaadin Charts. The SVG button downloads the raw SVG
	as a file, the PDF button further uses the iText library to embed it into
	a PDF file.</p>
<p>The third button renders the same chart using the Swing UI library.
	Naturally the window containing the chart will be displayed on the
	server, so you can see something only if running the this example app
	on your local machine.</p>
